# Finding Donors Student Project <br>
This is a student project from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict which individuals are most likely to donate to a charity based on demographic and financial data.
 <br>
##  Installation <br>
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies: <br>
 <br>
Python 3.5 or higher  <br>
NumPy <br>
pandas <br>
scikit-learn <br>
matplotlib <br>
You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command: <br>
 <br>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br> <br>

## Usage <br>
To run the project, open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command: <br>
 <br>

python finding_donors.py <br> <br>
This will run the machine learning model and output the results to the console. <br>
 <br>
##  Files <br>
The project contains the following files: <br>
 <br>
census.csv: The dataset used to train and test the machine learning model. <br>
finding_donors.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook used to develop the machine learning model. <br>
finding_donors.html: An HTML export of the Jupyter notebook. <br>
finding_donors.py: The Python script that contains the final machine learning model. <br>
visuals.py: A Python script that contains visualization functions used in the Jupyter notebook and Python script. <br>
README.md: This file. <br>
 <br>
##  Credits
The census.csv dataset was provided by Udacity as part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. The project was completed by Natasha Estrada
